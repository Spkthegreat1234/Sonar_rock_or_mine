Based on the content of the provided Jupyter Notebook, I will create a `README.md` file. The notebook appears to deal with rock and mine detection using machine learning techniques, specifically using logistic regression.

Here is the `README.md` file:

# 📊 Rock vs. Mine Detection

This project uses machine learning to distinguish between rocks and mines based on sonar data. The dataset contains sonar signals bounced off different objects, and the goal is to classify these objects as either rocks (R) or mines (M).

## 📝 Project Description

The project involves:
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Loading and understanding the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing data, etc.
3. **Model Training**: Using Logistic Regression to train the model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy score.

## 📁 Files

- `rock_mine_detection.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow from data loading to model evaluation.
- `sonar_data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model (not included in this repository).

## 🛠️ Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## 📊 Data Collection and Testing

The dataset used is the "Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Each sample is a set of 60 sonar readings, and the label indicates whether the object is a rock or a mine.

## 🧠 Model Training

We use Logistic Regression for this classification task. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy. Further evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score can be added for a more comprehensive evaluation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-mine-detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd rock-mine-detection
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook rock_mine_detection.ipynb
    ```
